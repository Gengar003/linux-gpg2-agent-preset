This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub  rsa4096/47625A42 2018-08-16
      Key fingerprint = 9502 23D0 8996 60AA B66B  4331 62D2 D85D 4762 5A42
uid                  Dummy Key (This keypair was generated as part of an example repo; the private key and passphrase are known to the world.) <nobody@example.com>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--gen-revoke" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
